This file is to display current maintainer's device name and past device maintainer's name & this will be modified by Ankit Kene when he wants in your repo  & you don't need to do this changes 
But if you want to do you can changes are simple release Ankit_kene with your name in 1 line then template word is used 4 times in above to download badges which will show repo not found or Release not found 
Cause there are no Release uploaded in this repo note V of version should be same your build tag if use" V " then use " V " for Download badge to and same for x v ". Example V1.5 is tag in Release build them use same 
Thanks you for reading and joining
